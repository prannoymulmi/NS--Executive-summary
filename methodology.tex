\chapter{Analysis}
\section{Summary of the Scope}
The scope comprised the examination of the network resources and vulnerabilities present in the web application. The resources were assessed using the following angles of attack:
\begin{itemize}
    \item As an external user with no access to internal network resources. This approach is taken to assess the application from the perspective of a genuine hacker with no prior information about the system.
    \item As an external website visitor using the browser without admin access. This approach is taken to observe some risks that can be observed visually from the CMS sites.
\end{itemize}

\section{Threat Modeling}
Threat modeling is a technique that allows us to detect and address top threats that can have a significant impact on the application \citep{threat_modeling}, also used in this assessment. The threats in the table will be tested against the system to detect any vulnerabilities.
Using the DFD (see figure \ref{fig:dfd}), we can list some threats utilizing the model.

\section{Vulnerability Assessment}
For the vulnerability assessment, the automated tools (see table \ref{table:tools}) mentioned in the baseline analysis were used to scan for known threats using the adversary behaviors defined in MITRE Enterprise ATT\&CK matrix \citep[p.~158]{xiong2022cyber}.

\begin{comment}
Additionally, the assessment and reconnaissance are performed using the MITRE Enterprise ATT\&CK matrix \citep{mitre_url}, as this model describes the adversary behaviors that measure the system's resilience at an enterprise level \citep[p.~158]{xiong2022cyber}.

\section{GDPR Analysis}
Using the GDPR compliance checklist, the website is evaluated for compliance with GDPR \citep{gdpr_checklist}. Failure to comply with GDPR rules with severe violations can be fined up to 4\% of the total turnover, or â‚¬20 million \citep[p.~32]{eu_fines}. Table \ref{table:gdpr} summarizes the discovered GDPR compliance results for the CMS system.

    \item A representative in the European Union is required as the CRM is hosted in the United States and processes personal data, which is unknown.

\vspace{-\baselineskip}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A consent layer for informing users of the information the cookies collect is missing.

\end{enumerate}\\

The databases containing personal data are available on the public internet, creating a risk of personal data breaches.\\

 Logging and monitoring to detect unusual behaviors are required but cannot be confirmed.
\\
\hline
Art.38 & Presence of Data Protection Officer.  &  
 A data protection officer handling critical breach incidents is required. The availability of the DPO is unknown.
\\
\hline
Art.32 & Security of Processing.  &  
\vspace{-\baselineskip}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Unencrypted email servers with ports (110, 143, 465, 587, and 2525) are used and are susceptible to man-in-the- middle-attacks.
    \item The CRM website uses TLS-encrypted connections for data exchange. Unencrypted ports, i.e., 80 and 8080, are redirected to encrypted ones.  
\end{enumerate}\\
\hline
\end{longtable}
\endgroup
After evaluating the CMS system with the GDPR directive (see Table \ref{table:gdpr}), it can be concluded that significant shortcomings are present in the system, which break the GDPR directive, as many required features like privacy policy, cookie consent, data protection are not adequately implemented and the company can be fined for not them.

\section{CIS Analysis}
%An evaluation of the CIS v8 framework is a set of recommended actions to prevent common attacks on networks and systems. 
An evaluation of the CIS v8 framework is chosen as it prioritizes a simple list of steps in comparison to other frameworks, which can be easily implemented also by small and medium-sized organizations with a low budget \citep[p.~59]{CIS}. Table \ref{table:cis} summarizes the evident shortcomings of the system according to the CIS control safeguards.

\section{Limitations}
The assessment consisted of a few constraints as the project. The following limitations were encountered during the vulnerability assessment.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Evaluating against the frameworks, the points requiring internal organizational knowledge could not be verified, i.e., backups exist, data encryption at rest, the presence of Logs and SIEM, presence of data protection officers. Herefore, the system could only be evaluated partially. 
    \item Some GDPR articles concerning Right to Access, Correct, and Erase Data cannot be evaluated, as we do not have access to any valid user. 
    \item On-site assessments could not be done, as the data centers are physically out of reach for us.
    \item All intrusive testing to verify the found exploits could not be carried out, as there are no legal permissions to attack the system, leading to only assumptions about the blast radius of the vulnerabilities.
\end{enumerate}





\section{Findings}
Testing discovered 9 key issues in the system according to business risk, and Figure \ref{fig:bar_rankings} depicts the total number of cases according to their order.

\section{Key Findings}

List of security threats found in comparison to the baseline analysis are listed below:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Phishing and social engineering of the mail servers.
    \item Denial of service due to some CVEs in the old database versions and mitigations like CDN also not present.
    \item Cross-Site Scripting as headers are not implemented in the CMS site.
    \item Security misconfigurations as many ports are made public unnecessarily.
    \item Ransomware attacks can be carried out with more ease, as important data-stores are open in public.
\end{enumerate}

\cellcolor{red!95} Critical  & Privacy policy and cookie confirmation for users not available, therefore breaking GDPR directive. & A detailed cookie consent form and privacy policy, that a user can explicitly confirm to use the site should be implemented \citep[p.~2]{godr_cookie}.
\\
\hline
\cellcolor{red!55} High  & Insecure database versions  containing multiple CVEs. This can lead to personal data theft.
 & The vulnerable versions of the database must be updated to a secure one. In addition, regular security automatic scans with dynamic and static application testing should be carried out.
\\

\cellcolor{red!55} High  & Mail servers are unencrypted and could be intercepted, leading to a leak of sensitive information. & The mail servers should use TLSv1.3 to encrypt the traffic from getting intercepted during transit.\citep[p.~10]{tls_smtp}.

\section{Conclusion}
Looking at table \ref{table:key_findings}, it can be concluded that the CMS system has severe critical flaws such as non-GDPR compliance because of missing privacy policies and consent, databases that might contain sensitive personal data are with open ports in the public internet. These errors pose a significant danger to the security operations of the system from attackers. Additionally, since the system is not GDPR conform, therefore is liable to be fined for not imposing the required elements. Herefore, the website is not production ready without resolving the high and critical issues from the findings.
