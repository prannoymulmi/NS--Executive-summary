\chapter{Limitations}
The assessment consisted of a few constraints as the project.  The following limitations were encountered during the vulnerability assessment.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Evaluating against the frameworks, the points requiring internal organizational knowledge could not be verified, i.e., backups exist, data encryption at rest, and the presence of Logs and SIEM. Therefore the system could not be evaluated completely 
    \item On-site assessments could not be done, as the data centers are physically out of reach for us.
    \item All intrusive testing,i.e., SQL injections and malware uploads, to verify the exploits could not be carried out, as there are no legal permissions to carry out such tests.
    \item Ping-based tests are avoided, as the site is a shared hosting consisting of other CMS sites with the IP, which would not bring any more useful information.
\end{enumerate}
