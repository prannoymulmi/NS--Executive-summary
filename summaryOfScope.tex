\chapter{Summary of the Scope}
The scope comprised the examination of the network resources and vulnerabilities present in the web application. The resources were assessed using the following angles of attack:
\begin{itemize}
    \item As an external user with no access to internal network resources. This approach is taken to assess the application from the perspective of a genuine hacker with no prior information about the system.
    \item As an external website visitor using the browser without admin access. This approach is taken to observe some risks that can be observed visually from the CMS sites.
\end{itemize}
The testing was performed manually using a VM Kali Linux, and the tools installed, as the IP used for testing is not whitelisted; there is a possibility of getting blocked during the assessment.
